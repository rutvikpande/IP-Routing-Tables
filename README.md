Handling Routing Tables using relevant data structures.


Routing Table:
             Routing table is a data table that lists the routes to particular network destinations.
             
Routing Table associated with:
        1)Necessary information to forward packets.
        2)Forwarding that be achieved through the network of routers.
        3)Providing with the most efficient path from the various options available.
        
DATA STRUCTURES USED:

    Graph:
		    To handle router nodes.   
    		Representations Used:
              	    Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List.

    Linked List:
		    To represent devices connected to routers.
